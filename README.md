# Integral Approximator
A simple GUI to approximate integrals via the trapezoidal, midpoint, and Simpson's rules, while also integrating via the regular method if possible. It also returns the error bounds for each approximation. Written in Python using the PySimpleGUI and SymPy libraries.

## How to use
Simply run the `main.py` file, insert an expression, the range from which to integrate, and the number of segments to divide the area calculations in. Then press the calculate button and below it should show all the results along with their error bounds.
